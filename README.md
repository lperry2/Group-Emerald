# TCSS 360 B - Developing Quality Software (SPRING 2024)
### Group Emerald 🟩
- Alex Ewing, Owen Orlic, Lucas Perry, Daniel Alberto Sanchez Aguilar


## PROJECT INFORMATION, ASSIGNMENTS, and DELIVERABLES

- Iteration 0 - within the newly created repository, create an empty application UI (a window with a close button) as product version v0.00

- Iteration 1 - validates the team repository and “ships” product version v0.10 with functionality for a basic About screen.

- Iteration 2 - your team ships product version v0.20 including unit tests and additional functionality to be defined such as data input and export.

- Iteration 3 - your team ships product version v1.00 (actually your 3rd deliverable) with functionality from your Design Deliverable.




- The project your team will take on is based on the Client Interview
#### There will be 3 major deliverables and two incremental exercises as part of that project:
- Requirements
- Design 
- Tested Code
- Your team will also keep a repository and web pages. While not a graded deliverable they are a focal point for collaboration and are essential tools for delivering your project. 

## Client Interview 

Remember the basics of a client interview -

- What is it you do and how do you do it? (Mr. Decker, how do you save links to web information?)
- Collect artifacts like reports, forms, examples. (Can you show me some of your sketches you would scan and upload?)
- What makes it difficult to do?
- What would be a perfect solution?
