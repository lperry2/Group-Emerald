## PROJECT INFORMATION, ASSIGNMENTS, and DELIVERABLES

- The project your team will take on is based on the Client Interview
#### There will be 3 major deliverables and two incremental exercises as part of that project:
- Requirements
- Design 
- Tested Code
- Your team will also keep a repository and web pages. While not a graded deliverable they are a focal point for collaboration and are essential tools for delivering your project. 

## Client Interview 

Remember the basics of a client interview -

- What is it you do and how do you do it? (Mr. Decker, how do you save links to web information?)
- Collect artifacts like reports, forms, examples. (Can you show me some of your sketches you would scan and upload?)
- What makes it difficult to do?
- What would be a perfect solution?
